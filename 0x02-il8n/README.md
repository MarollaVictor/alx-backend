Flask-Babel
Flask-Babel is an extension to Flask that adds i18n and l10n support to any Flask application with the help of babel, pytz and speaklater. It has builtin support for date formatting with timezone support as well as a very simple and friendly interface to gettext translations.

Installation
Install the extension from PyPi:

$ pip install Flask-Babel
Please note that Flask-Babel requires Jinja >=2.5. If you are using an older version you will have to upgrade or disable the Jinja support (see configuration).

Configuration
To get started all you need to do is to instantiate a Babel object after configuring the application:

from flask import Flask
from flask_babel import Babel

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config.from_pyfile('mysettings.cfg')
babel = Babel(app)
To disable jinja support, include configure_jinja=False in the Babel constructor call. The babel object itself can be used to configure the babel support further. Babel has the following configuration values that can be used to change some internal defaults:

BABEL_DEFAULT_LOCALE

The default locale to use if no locale selector is registered. This defaults to 'en'.

BABEL_DEFAULT_TIMEZONE

The timezone to use for user facing dates. This defaults to 'UTC' which also is the timezone your application must use internally.

BABEL_TRANSLATION_DIRECTORIES

A semi-colon (;) separated string of absolute and relative (to the app root) paths to translation folders. Defaults to translations.

BABEL_DOMAIN

The message domain used by the application. Defaults to messages.

For more complex applications you might want to have multiple applications for different users which is where selector functions come in handy. The first time the babel extension needs the locale (language code) of the current user it will call a localeselector() function, and the first time the timezone is needed it will call a timezoneselector() function.

If any of these methods return None the extension will automatically fall back to whatâ€™s in the config. Furthermore for efficiency that function is called only once and the return value then cached. If you need to switch the language between a request, you can refresh() the cache.

Example selector functions:

from flask import g, request

@babel.localeselector
def get_locale():
    # if a user is logged in, use the locale from the user settings
    user = getattr(g, 'user', None)
    if user is not None:
        return user.locale
    # otherwise try to guess the language from the user accept
    # header the browser transmits.  We support de/fr/en in this
    # example.  The best match wins.
    return request.accept_languages.best_match(['de', 'fr', 'en'])

@babel.timezoneselector
def get_timezone():
    user = getattr(g, 'user', None)
    if user is not None:
        return user.timezone
The example above assumes that the current user is stored on the flask.g object.
